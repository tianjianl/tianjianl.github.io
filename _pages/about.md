HiðŸ‘‹, I'm Tianjian! I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, proudly advised by Prof. [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/). I am also a research intern at [Meta FAIR](https://ai.meta.com/research/), where I have the privilege to be advised by [Tianlu Wang](https://tianlu-wang.github.io/).

Previously, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at JHU. I worked with my wonderful advisors [Kenton Murray](https://kentonmurray.com/) and [Philipp Koehn](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/). Before that, I was an undergraduate at New York University.

My research lies at the intersection between machine learning and natural language processing.

I prefer solutions that are simple, generalizable, and theoretically sound.

If you have anything to share with me, please feel free to contact me through my email: tli104 at jhu.edu

Hi👋, I'm Tianjian! I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Johns Hopkins University, proudly advised by Prof. [Daniel Khashabi](https://danielkhashabi.com/). Previously, I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science at JHU, where I had the privilege of working closely with my wonderful advisors, [Kenton Murray](https://kentonmurray.com/) and [Philipp Koehn](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/). Before that, I was an undergraduate at New York University.

My research lies at the intersection between machine learning and natural language processing.

I prefer solutions that are simple, generalizable, and theoretically sound.

If you have anything to share with me, please feel free to contact me through my email: tli104 at jhu.edu
